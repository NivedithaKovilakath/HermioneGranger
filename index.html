                    head of the governing body of the wizarding world.<br>
                    I am known around the world for helping defeat Lord Voldemort, <br>
                    along with Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley. <br>
                    I have also been called the brightest witch of my generation</p>

                <p>I am a Muggle-born witch, and I went to Hogwarts when the anti-muggleborn sentiment was on the rise.<br>
                I was bullied, and called slurs throughout my childhood.<br>
                So, I have made it my life's mission to ensure that no other child has to face injustice like I did.</p>

                   I graduated from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1998,<br>
                   where I was sorted into Griffindor.<br>
                   I received ten OWLs and seven NEWTs for my academic performance.<br>
                   I was also a prefect during my time at the school.

               I joined the Ministry of Magic right after I graduated from Hogwarts. <br>
               I worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where I played a big part in <br>
               eliminating laws biased against muggle-born witches and wizards.<br>
               I have also been an advocate for the rights of house elves. <br>
               I became the Minister of Magic in 2019.
