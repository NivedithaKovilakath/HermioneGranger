                    <h2>About</h2>
                   <p>I am an English Muggle-born witch,              
                       and my parents were both Dentists.
                   I have made it my life's mission to fight against
                   muggle-born injustice and to promote
                       Elfish welfare.</p>

                  <p>I graduated from Hogwarts School of 
                      Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1998,
                  where I was sorted into Griffindor.
                  I received ten OWLs and seven NEWTs for 
                      my academic performance.
                   I was also a prefect during my time at school. </p>

                    <h2> Work </h2>
                    <p> I was one of the founders of Dumbledore's Army and help fight against Lord Voldemort 
                        I joined the Ministry of Magic right after I graduated from Hogwarts. 
                    I worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where I played a big part in
                    eliminating laws biased against muggle-born witches and wizards.
                    I have also been an advocate for the rights of house elves  
                        and founded The Society for Promotion of Elfish Welfare(S.P.E.W) when I was at Hogwarts. 
                        I became the Minister of Magic in 2019. </p>
