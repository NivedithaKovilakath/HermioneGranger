                   I graduated from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where I was sorted into Griffindor.<br>
                   I received ten OWLs and seven NEWTs for my academic performance.<br>
                   I was also a prefect during my time at the school.

               I joined the Ministry of Magic right after I graduated from Hogwarts. <br>
               I worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where I played a big part in <br>
               eliminating laws biased against muggle-born witches and wizards.<br>
               I have also been an advocate for the rights of house elves. <br>
               I became the Minister of Magic in 2019.
