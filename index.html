                     <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>I am an English Muggle-born witch, and my parents were both Dentists. <br> 
                    I have made it my life's mission to fight against muggle-born <br>
                    injustice and to promote Elfish welfare.</p>
                   <p>I graduated from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1998,<br>
                   where I was sorted into Griffindor.<br>
                   I received ten OWLs and seven NEWTs for my academic performance.<br>
                    I was also a prefect during my time at the school. </p>

            <a id = "work"> </a>
            <div class="workright">
               <p> I was one of the founders of Dumbledore's Army and help fight against Lord Voldemort <br>
                   I joined the Ministry of Magic right after I graduated from Hogwarts. <br>
               I worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where I played a big part in <br>
               eliminating laws biased against muggle-born witches and wizards.<br>
               I have also been an advocate for the rights of house elves  <br>
                   and founded The Society for Promotion of Elfish Welfare(S.P.E.W) when I was at Hogwarts. <br>
                   I became the Minister of Magic in 2019. </p>
