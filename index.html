                     <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I am an English Muggle-born witch,
                        and my parents were both Dentists.
                    I have made it my life's mission to fight against
                    muggle-born injustice and to promote <br>
                        Elfish welfare.</p>
                   <p>I graduated from Hogwarts School of <br>
                       Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1998,<br>
                   where I was sorted into Griffindor.<br>
                   I received ten OWLs and seven NEWTs for <br>
                       my academic performance.<br>
                    I was also a prefect during my time at school. </p>

                <h2> Work </h2>
               <p> I was one of the founders of Dumbledore's Army and help fight against Lord Voldemort <br>
                   I joined the Ministry of Magic right after I graduated from Hogwarts. <br>
               I worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where I played a big part in
               eliminating laws biased against muggle-born witches and wizards.<br>
               I have also been an advocate for the rights of house elves  <br>
                   and founded The Society for Promotion of Elfish Welfare(S.P.E.W) when I was at Hogwarts. <br>
                   I became the Minister of Magic in 2019. </p>
